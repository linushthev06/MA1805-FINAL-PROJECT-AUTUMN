“Data Shadows” is an interactive digital art piece developed using p5.js that looks to highlight how data leaves invisible trails every time humans interact with digital devices. The artwork is based on the concept of ‘digital shadows.’ The digital shadow basically refers to data generated from basic human actions, such as mouse movements and keyboard buttons pressed. The objective here is to make these invisible trails visible to ensure users show just how much data they generate online unintentionally.

When the user moves their mouse, it leaves trails of glowing particles. The particles fade but never goes away completely. It represents digital footprints even after they have disappeared. When typing, it shows every letter typed as a floating word. They fade but do not go away completely. The effect signifies how searches and typed words leave their mark, just like digital footprints. The digital footprint represents data created by users continuously. The result of these elements creates a ghostly effect of data.

The concept for this project comes from articles related to data tracking and digital identity. Specifically, The Atlantic's "The Internet Knows You Better Than You Know Yourself" article (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/12/internet-knows-you/603160/) talks about how companies use our behaviour to create profiles. The explanation from Mozilla (https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/what-is-data-tracking/) about data tracking also helped to form the concept of this project. 

A number of issues were encountered during development. Initially, the application would slow down due to the creation of particles whenever the mouse moved faster. The issue was resolved by putting the transparency and removing particles whenever they became invisible to the eye. Also, letters would appear messy due to their overlaps, so adding the fade functions helped to ensure the screen isn't messy. As well as, the canvas would not be displayed properly across different screens; therefore, resizing helped a lot to display the canvas.
